# maximalflagcodes

As the date of 16 January, 2023, our computational work finished and the exact result is 328672649760. So there exist this number of maximal flag codes of type-(1,2) with d=4 in F_2^4 as we has already given the related theorem and proposition in the paper that we would have updated this page. At the end, our calculation has been done in 14 days by the linux version of MAGMA modified on 07.07.2021. We run this progrram correctly and reached the exact number. We put 522980 of them in the document and it reached the limit of github for a single document which is 25 MB.
