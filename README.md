# maximalflagcodes

As the date of 16 January, 2023, our computational work has been terminated and the exact result is 328672649760. So there exist this number of maximal full flag codes of type-(1,2) with d=4 in F_2^4 as we has already given the related theorem and proposition in the paper that we would have updated this page. At the end, our calculation has been done in 14 days by the linux version of MAGMA modified on 07.07.2021.
